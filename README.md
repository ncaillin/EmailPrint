# EmailPrint
python program that automatically prints recent emails [incomplete]

this program is incomplete - currently it functions to read last n emails in an inbox and download attachments.
I'll add the printer integration eventually - python doesn't have native print handling.

to use it just update the fields in the config - note that for gmail you need to use an app password
